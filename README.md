## Installation

In order to install moonstone, you have to build it from scratch. Don't worry,
it's an incredibly easy process.

1. Install rustup from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/)
2. Install gcc
3. Clone the repository
   > `git clone https://github.com/peonii/moonstone.git`
4. Run `cargo build --release`
5. Copy `mst` from `target/release/` to a folder with your binaries

## File Structure

```
üìÑ main.alg - Main algorithm
üìÑ brute.alg - Brute-force algorithm (used for generating output)
üìÑ gen.alg - Input generator
```

*Why do I have to use .alg files?*
This is for comfort, to not have to paste the same lines in every single program you write.
Why not use default files instead? Because some programs may require something extra.
This also cleans the code up and allows for nicer, more readable algorithms.

*Can I disable the replacer?*
You will be able to disable it in the next update.
